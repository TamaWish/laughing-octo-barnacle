# Relationships Screen Navigation Fix

## Issue
The Relationships screen was not showing when the user tapped the Relationships button in the bottom navigation bar.

## Root Cause
In `src/components/AppShell.tsx`, the Relationships button was calling `goToGameTab('Relationships')`, which attempted to navigate to the GameScreen with a 'Relationships' tab. However, GameScreen doesn't handle a 'Relationships' tab case - instead, it navigates to a separate Relationships screen.

This created a navigation loop/conflict where:
1. User taps Relationships in AppShell
2. AppShell tries to navigate to Game with 'Relationships' tab
3. GameScreen receives the 'Relationships' tab but immediately navigates away to the Relationships screen
4. This may have caused navigation confusion or the screen not displaying

## Solution
Changed the Relationships button in AppShell to directly navigate to the Relationships screen (like the Activities button does), instead of trying to go through GameScreen.

### Code Change
**File**: `src/components/AppShell.tsx` (line ~235)

**Before**:
```tsx
<TouchableOpacity 
  style={[styles.navItem, currentGameTab === 'Relationships' && styles.navItemActive]} 
  onPress={() => goToGameTab('Relationships')}
>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<TouchableOpacity 
  style={[styles.navItem, currentGameTab === 'Relationships' && styles.navItemActive]} 
  onPress={() => { 
    const setTab = useGameStore.getState().setCurrentGameTab; 
    setTab && setTab('Relationships'); 
    navigation && navigation.navigate('Relationships'); 
  }}
>
```

## Result
✅ Tapping the Relationships button in the bottom nav bar now correctly navigates to the Relationships screen
✅ The screen is displayed as a separate, standalone screen (not shared with GameScreen)
✅ Navigation is consistent with how the Activities screen works

## Architecture Notes

### Screens That Share GameScreen (Inline Tabs):
- **Home** - Default tab with action suggestions and event log
- **Career** - Career management rendered inline
- **Assets** - Assets management rendered inline  
- **Skills** - Skills display rendered inline

### Screens That Are Separate (Not in GameScreen):
- **Activities** - Standalone screen with AppShell wrapper
- **Relationships** - Standalone screen with AppShell wrapper
- **Education** - Standalone screen with AppShell wrapper
- **FindJob** - Standalone screen with AppShell wrapper
- **FreelanceGigs** - Standalone screen with AppShell wrapper
- **PartTimeJobs** - Standalone screen with AppShell wrapper

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Run the app
2. Navigate to the Game screen
3. Tap the Relationships button (heart icon) in the bottom nav bar
4. The Relationships screen should now display correctly
5. The top header should show profile info and money
6. The bottom nav bar should remain visible
7. You should be able to interact with relationship members

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/components/AppShell.tsx` - Fixed Relationships navigation button
