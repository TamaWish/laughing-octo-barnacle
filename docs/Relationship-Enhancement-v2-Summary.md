# ✨ Conflict System Enhancements - Implementation Summary

## 📅 Update Date
October 18, 2025

---

## 🎯 What Was Enhanced

### 1. ✅ Compliment & Conversation Now Prevent Decay
Previously, only "Spend Time" and "Give Gift" updated `lastInteractionDate`. Now all positive interactions track engagement!

**New Actions:**
- **Compliment** (+2 relationship, +1 happiness, updates lastInteractionDate)
- **Conversation** (+3 relationship, +2 happiness, updates lastInteractionDate)

**Benefits:**
- More interaction variety
- Players have free options to prevent decay
- Better balance between paid and free actions

---

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Toast Notifications
Argument toasts now show full context with escalation warnings and specific topics!

**Before:**
```
❌ Argument started
You argued with Mom
```

**After:**
```
⚠️ Argument Escalated!
You argued with Mom about career choices 
(-15 relationship, +20 conflict)
```

**Details Shown:**
- 🔥 Escalation warning (when applicable)
- 📝 Specific argument topic
- 📊 Exact relationship change
- ⚡ Conflict increase amount
- ⏱️ Longer visibility time (4 seconds)

---

### 3. ✅ Animated Conflict Badges
Conflict indicators now animate when relationships deteriorate!

**Animation Features:**
- **Shake Effect**: Badge shakes left-right when conflict increases
- **Pulse Effect**: Badge scales up and down to draw attention
- **Smooth Transitions**: All animations use native driver for 60fps
- **Reactive**: Automatically triggers when conflict level changes

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
- Shake: 10px → -10px → 10px → 0px (200ms total)
- Pulse: 1.0x → 1.3x → 1.0x (400ms total)
- Triggers: When conflictLevel increases
```

## 📁 Files Modified

### Store Actions
**`src/store/gameStore.ts`**

**New Actions Added:**
```typescript
complimentFamilyMember(memberId: string): void
// +2 relationship, +1 happiness, updates lastInteractionDate

conversationWithFamilyMember(memberId: string): void
// +3 relationship, +2 happiness, updates lastInteractionDate
```

**Modified Actions:**
```typescript
startArgument(memberId: string): {
  memberName: string;
  topic: string;
  escalated: boolean;
  relationshipChange: number;
  conflictChange: number;
} | null
// Now returns detailed result object for enhanced toasts
```

### UI Components
**`src/screens/RelationshipsScreen.tsx`**

**New Components:**
```typescript
<AnimatedConflictBadge 
  conflictLevel={number} 
  memberId={string} 
/>
// Animated badge with shake and pulse effects
```

**Updated Handlers:**
- `handleCompliment()` - Now calls `complimentFamilyMember`
- `handleConversation()` - Now calls `conversationWithFamilyMember`
- `handleArgue()` - Now uses return value for enhanced toast

**Enhanced Toast Messages:**
- Show escalation warnings
- Display argument topics
- Include numeric changes
- Longer visibility (4000ms)

## 🎮 How to Test

### Test Compliment/Conversation Decay Prevention:

1. **Setup:**
   - Create a test relationship
   - Note current relationship score
   - Note current game date

2. **Test:**
   - Use "Compliment" or "Conversation" action
   - Advance year
   - Check relationship - should NOT decay

3. **Expected Result:**
   - No decay occurs (lastInteractionDate updated)
   - Event log shows no decay for that member

---

### Test Enhanced Toast Notifications:

1. **Test Normal Argument:**
   - Find member with high relationship score (80+)
   - Start argument
   - Observe toast shows topic and exact numbers

2. **Test Escalated Argument:**
   - Find member with low relationship score (20-)
   - Start argument
   - Observe "⚠️ Argument Escalated!" warning
   - Note larger negative numbers

---

### Test Animated Conflict Badge:

1. **Setup:**
   - Find member with no conflict
   - Keep relationships screen open

2. **Trigger Animation:**
   - Start argument with that member
   - Watch for shake and pulse animation

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - Badge appears with red background
   - Shakes left-right quickly
   - Pulses larger then returns to normal
   - Animation completes in ~400ms

## 📊 Comparison Table

### Action Effects (Updated)

| Action | Relationship | Happiness | Cost | Prevents Decay |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------|----------------|
| Spend Time | +5 | +2 | Free | ✅ |
| Give Gift | +10 | 0 | €100 | ✅ |
| **Compliment** | **+2** | **+1** | **Free** | **✅** |
| **Conversation** | **+3** | **+2** | **Free** | **✅** |
| Argue (Normal) | -8 | -3 | Free | ✅ (but damages) |
| Argue (Escalated) | -15 | -5 | Free | ✅ (but damages) |
| Apologize | Variable | +2 | Free | ✅ |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Compliment Action Logic:
```typescript
complimentFamilyMember(memberId) {
  // Find member across all relationship arrays
  // Update: relationshipScore +2
  // Update: lastInteractionDate = gameDate
  // Set: happiness +1
  // Log event
}
```

### Enhanced Toast Logic:
```typescript
const result = startArgument(memberId);
if (result) {
  const { memberName, topic, escalated, relationshipChange, conflictChange } = result;
  Toast.show({
    type: 'error',
    text1: escalated ? '⚠️ Argument Escalated!' : 'Argument Started',
    text2: `Argued about ${topic} (${relationshipChange}, +${conflictChange} conflict)`,
    visibilityTime: 4000
  });
}
```

### Animation Implementation:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (conflictLevel > prevConflictLevel) {
    // Shake sequence
    Animated.sequence([
      timing(shakeAnim, { toValue: 10 }),
      timing(shakeAnim, { toValue: -10 }),
      timing(shakeAnim, { toValue: 10 }),
      timing(shakeAnim, { toValue: 0 })
    ]).start();
    
    // Pulse sequence
    Animated.sequence([
      timing(pulseAnim, { toValue: 1.3 }),
      timing(pulseAnim, { toValue: 1.0 })
    ]).start();
  }
}, [conflictLevel]);
```

- ❌ Generic argument toasts
- ❌ Static conflict badges

### After:
- ✅ All positive actions prevent decay
- ✅ Detailed argument toasts with topics
- ✅ Animated conflict badges with shake/pulse
- ✅ Escalation warnings clearly visible
- ✅ Numeric details shown in toasts

---

## 📝 Event Log Examples

**New Compliment Events:**
```
Complimented Sarah. Relationship +2, Happiness +1.
```

**New Conversation Events:**
```
Had a conversation with John. Relationship +3, Happiness +2.
```

**Enhanced Argument Events:**
```

Relationship -15, Conflict +20, Happiness -5.
```
