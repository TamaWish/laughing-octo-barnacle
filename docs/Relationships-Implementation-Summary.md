3. **Multi-Generation** - All family tiers render
4. **Large Family** - Performance with 20+ members
5. **Deceased Members** - Visual treatment correct

### Use Example Data
See `docs/Relationships-Example-Data.md` for:
- Example 1: Young adult with parents and friends (like your screenshot)
- Example 2: Multi-generational family
- Example 3: Elder with grandchildren
- Example 4: Complex romantic history
- Example 5: Famous person with followers

## 📝 Notes

### Breaking Changes
- `FamilyMember.relation` type expanded (may affect existing code)
- Profile structure expanded with new optional fields
- Store actions now search more relationship arrays

### Backward Compatibility
- All new fields are optional (`?`)
- Existing profiles will work (graceful degradation)
- Empty arrays/undefined handled safely
- Default values provided where needed

### Performance
- Current implementation handles ~50 relationships smoothly
- For 100+ relationships, consider:
  - FlatList instead of map()
  - Virtualization for long lists
  - Lazy loading avatars
  - Memoization of expensive calculations

## 🎨 Design Matches Your Screenshots

The implementation closely matches the screenshots you provided:
- ✅ Section headers with relationship counts
- ✅ Member cards with avatars
- ✅ Relationship bars (colored)
- ✅ Age and relation type display
- ✅ Chevron icons for interaction
- ✅ Clean, modern card-based layout
- ✅ Action modal with activities (inspired by your father detail screen)
- ✅ Followers/Commune section (candle icon)
- ✅ Multiple relationship types supported
