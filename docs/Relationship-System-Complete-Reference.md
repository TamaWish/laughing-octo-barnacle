## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Models
```typescript
FamilyMember {
  id: string
  relation: RelationType
  relationshipScore: number (0-100)
  conflictLevel: number (0-100)
  lastInteractionDate: string (ISO)
  alive: boolean
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Store Actions
```typescript
// Positive
spendTimewithFamilyMember(memberId)
giveGiftToFamilyMember(memberId, cost)
complimentFamilyMember(memberId)           // NEW v2
conversationWithFamilyMember(memberId)     // NEW v2

// Conflict
startArgument(memberId) → Result | null    // Enhanced v2
apologize(memberId)
```

### Utility Functions

// Decay calculations
calculateYearsSinceLastInteraction()
calculateDecayAmount()
applyDecayToMember()

## 📈 Decay Rate Reference

### Base Decay (per year without interaction)

| Relationship Type | Decay/Year | Reasoning |
|------------------|------------|-----------|
| Parent/Child | -2 | Strong family bond |
| Sibling | -3 | Family but more distant |
| Grandparent/Grandchild | -3 | Generational gap |
| Best Friend | -4 | Requires regular contact |
| Partner/Lover | -5 | High maintenance |
| Friend | -5 | Needs active friendship |
| Ex | -1 | Already distant |
| Follower | -2 | Low expectation |

### Conflict Multiplier
**Formula:** `Final Decay = Base Decay × (1 + Conflict/100)`

**Examples:**
- 0 conflict: 1.0x multiplier (normal decay)
- 50 conflict: 1.5x multiplier (+50% decay)
- 100 conflict: 2.0x multiplier (double decay)

## 🎯 Escalation Reference

### Escalation Probability by Score

| Score Range | Escalation % | Risk Level |
|------------|--------------|------------|
| 0-20 | 70% | ⚠️ Very High |
| 21-40 | 50% | ⚠️ High |
| 41-60 | 30% | ⚡ Medium |
| 61-80 | 15% | ✅ Low |
| 81-100 | 5% | ✅ Very Low |
