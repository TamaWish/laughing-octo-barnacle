# **Kindergarten Education Catalog (Status 0 Pre-cursor)**

This catalog defines the optional pre-school/kindergarten phase, generally for Sims aged 3 to 5, before compulsory education begins.

The key mechanics for this stage are:

1. **Optional/Parent-Driven:** This stage is **not mandatory** and is driven by the family's financial resources or the Sim's parents' choices.  
2. **Stat Boost:** Enrollment provides a significant head-start by boosting **Smarts** (early learning) and **Happiness** (socializing). Private options often provide a larger boost.  
3. **Age Gating:** Enrollment is only possible between **Age 3 and Age 5**. Attendance automatically stops at the primary school starting age (e.g., Age 6 for US/JP/IN/DE/FR).  
4. **No Status Change:** Completion still results in **Status 0 (Uneducated)**, but the Sim graduates with higher base stats for primary school.
