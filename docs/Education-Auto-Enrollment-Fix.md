# Education Auto-Enrollment Fix

## Issue Description

The auto-enrollment system for compulsory education (kindergarten, primary, and secondary school) was not working correctly when students completed one level and should have automatically progressed to the next level.

### Specific Problem

Students who completed primary or secondary school were **not being automatically enrolled** in the next education level, even though the auto-enrollment logic existed. For example:

- **Australia**: A student completed preschool but was never enrolled in Primary School, even though they aged to 5, 12, etc.
- **France**: A student finished Ã‰cole Primaire but was never enrolled in CollÃ¨ge & LycÃ©e
- **All countries**: Students finishing primary school were not automatically enrolled in secondary school

## Root Cause

The issue was a **timing/order problem** in the `advanceYear()` function in `gameStore.ts`:

```typescript
// OLD (BUGGY) ORDER:
1. Auto-enrollment checks run first (lines 159-191)
2. Course progression/completion runs later (lines 208-230)
```

### Why This Failed

When a student was completing their final year of primary school:

1. **Step 1**: Auto-enrollment checks run â†’ Student is **still enrolled** in primary, so skip
2. **Step 2**: Course progression runs â†’ Completes primary school, sets:
   - `isCurrentlyEnrolled = false`
   - `educationStatus = 1` (completed primary)
3. **RESULT**: Student is now eligible for secondary school, but the auto-enrollment checks already ran!

## The Fix

### 1. Moved Auto-Enrollment Logic

The auto-enrollment logic was **moved to run AFTER course completion** instead of before:

```typescript
// NEW (FIXED) ORDER:
1. Course progression/completion runs first
2. Auto-enrollment checks run after (catches newly graduated students)
```

### 2. Improved Age Logic

Changed from strict age equality (`newAge === requiredAge`) to greater-than-or-equal (`newAge >= requiredAge`):

**Before:**
```typescript
if (primaryCourse && newAge === primaryCourse.requiredAge)
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (primaryCourse && newAge >= (primaryCourse.requiredAge ?? 0))
```

This handles edge cases where a student might be older than the typical starting age.

### 3. Changed Secondary Enrollment Condition

**Before:**
```typescript
if (get().educationStatus >= 1 && !get().isCurrentlyEnrolled)
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (get().educationStatus === 1 && !get().isCurrentlyEnrolled)
```

Changed to check for **exactly status 1** (completed primary) rather than >= 1, which prevents re-enrollment issues.

## Code Changes

### File: `src/store/gameStore.ts`

**Location of changes:** In the `advanceYear()` function

1. **Removed** auto-enrollment logic from before course progression (lines ~159-191)
2. **Added** auto-enrollment logic after course completion (after line ~197)
3. **Updated** age comparison logic from `===` to `>=`
4. **Updated** secondary enrollment check from `educationStatus >= 1` to `educationStatus === 1`

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite: `__tests__/gameStore.autoEnroll.test.ts`

All tests pass âœ…:

- âœ… Auto-enroll in primary school after preschool completion (Australia)
- âœ… Auto-enroll in secondary school after primary completion (Australia)
- âœ… Auto-enroll in primary school at age 6 if not enrolled (US)
- âœ… Auto-enroll in secondary school after primary completion (France)
- âœ… Auto-enroll in secondary school at age 11 for UK student with status 1
- âœ… Auto-enroll in primary school for Germany at age 6
- âœ… Auto-enroll in secondary school at age 10 for Germany after primary completion

## Country-Specific Auto-Enrollment Ages

All 8 countries now properly auto-enroll at these ages:

| Country | Preschool | Primary | Secondary |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US | Age 3 | Age 6 | Age 11 |
| ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ GB | Age 3 | Age 5 | Age 11 |
| ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ CA | Age 3 | Age 6 | Age 12 |
| ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º AU | Age 3 | Age 5 | Age 12 |
| ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ JP | Age 3 | Age 6 | Age 12 |
| ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ IN | Age 3 | Age 6 | Age 11 |
| ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª DE | Age 3 | Age 6 | Age 10 |
| ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· FR | Age 3 | Age 6 | Age 11 |

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: New Game Start
1. Player creates character at age 0
2. Ages to 3 â†’ **Auto-enrolled** in free public preschool
3. Ages to 5 (AU) or 6 (US) â†’ **Completes preschool** â†’ **Auto-enrolled** in primary school
4. Ages to 11-12 â†’ **Completes primary** â†’ **Auto-enrolled** in secondary school
5. Ages to 16-18 â†’ **Completes secondary** â†’ Player chooses university/college/vocational

### Scenario 2: Mid-Game Join
1. Player creates character at age 8 with `educationStatus: 0`
2. Character is not currently enrolled
3. Next year advancement â†’ **Auto-enrolled** in primary school (caught by `newAge >= requiredAge`)

### Scenario 3: Graduation Transition
1. Student is in final year of primary school
2. Advances year â†’ Completes primary, receives `educationStatus = 1`
3. **Immediately after completion** â†’ Auto-enrollment checks run â†’ **Enrolled in secondary school**

## Impact

This fix ensures:
- âœ… All students automatically progress through compulsory education
- âœ… No manual enrollment needed for kindergarten, primary, or secondary
- âœ… Works correctly for all 8 countries (US, GB, CA, AU, JP, IN, DE, FR)
- âœ… Handles edge cases (older students, status changes, graduation transitions)
- âœ… Consistent with real-world compulsory education systems
