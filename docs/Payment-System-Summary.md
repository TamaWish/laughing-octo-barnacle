## 🎯 Financial Examples

### Scenario A: Ivy League with Loan
```
Cost: $80k/year × 4 years = $320k
Payment: Student Loan

Enrollment:
  Money: $50k → $50k (no change)
  Debt: $0 → $320k

Graduation (4 years later):
  Attempt to pay $160k (50%)
  If sufficient: Money -= $160k, Debt = $160k
  If insufficient: Debt stays $320k, warning shown
```

### Scenario B: State University with Parents
```
Cost: $25k/year × 4 years = $100k
Payment: Ask Parents

Enrollment:
  Random check: 80% success
  If success: Money unchanged, Debt = $0
  If fail: Cannot enroll, try another option

Graduation (if enrolled):
  No repayment needed
  Debt-free!
```

### Scenario C: Private University with Cash
```
Cost: $60k/year × 4 years = $240k
Payment: Cash

Enrollment:
  Check: Money >= $240k?
  If yes: Money -= $240k, Debt = $0
  If no: Enrollment fails

Graduation:
  No repayment needed
  Debt-free!
```
