## Best Practices

### For Players:
1. **Maintain Balance**: Keep high relationships with family
2. **Regular Interaction**: Spend time regularly to maintain bonds
3. **Gift Strategically**: Save gifts for special occasions
4. **Prioritize**: Focus on important relationships first
5. **Watch Death**: Elderly members may pass away

### For Development:
1. **Performance**: Lazy load avatars for large families
2. **Data Persistence**: Save relationship states properly
3. **Validation**: Check member exists before actions
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data
5. **Accessibility**: Proper labels and roles for screen readers

## Color Scheme

- **Primary**: #3b82f6 (Blue) - Section headers, active states
- **Success**: #10b981 (Green) - High relationships, gifts
- **Warning**: #f59e0b (Yellow/Orange) - Medium relationships
- **Danger**: #ef4444 (Red) - Low relationships
- **Grey Scale**: 
  - #1f2937 (Dark) - Primary text
  - #6b7280 (Medium) - Secondary text
  - #9ca3af (Light) - Disabled/deceased
  - #e5e7eb (Very light) - Borders/backgrounds

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations:
- Relationship arrays can grow large (100+ members in some families)
- Use FlatList for very large lists (future optimization)
- Cache avatar resolutions
- Memoize relationship calculations

### State Management:
- Relationship data stored in profile object
- Actions update entire profile object
- Zustand handles persistence automatically
- Changes trigger re-renders only for affected components

### Animation:
- Modal: `slide` animation from bottom
- Touch feedback: opacity on press
- Layout: LayoutAnimation for smooth transitions
