# **Secondary Education Catalog (Status 1 → Status 2\)**

This catalog defines the mandatory secondary education phase, where Sims obtain the foundational credential required for college, vocational training, or immediate professional employment.

The key mechanics for this stage are:

1. **Automatic Enrollment:** Enrollment begins automatically when the Sim reaches the secondary school starting age, usually directly after obtaining **Status 1 (Primary Graduate)**.  
2. **Outcome Status:** Successful completion grants **Status 2 (Secondary School Graduate)**, unlocking all formal post-secondary options in the main course catalog.  
3. **Special Tracks:** For countries like Germany, the initial enrollment choice (Gymnasium, Realschule, etc.) may be driven by the Sim's inherited **Smarts** stat or performance in primary school events.  
4. **Stat Progression:** This longer phase offers significant opportunities to increase **Smarts** (through studying) and **Relationships** (through social events).
